    capabilities and knowledge of this service bot system. It is a Django application designed to
    accomodate a number of capabilities and features to provide keen insights about the system's
    performance as well as control over it. It is intended for the use of food bank administration ONLY so
    emphasis has been placed on user authentication and access control against unrestricted
    individuals. The feature pages of this web application for the system are as follows which will
    be discussed in more detail below: Audit logs, FAQs, Monitoring, and System Management.
